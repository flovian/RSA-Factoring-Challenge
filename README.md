# RSA Factoring Challenge

In this project, I learned about RSA Factoring.


## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Factorize all the things!**
  * [factors](./factors): Factorize as many numbers as possible
  into a product of two smaller numbers.
  * Returns the number of nodes in the list.

* **1. RSA Factoring Challenge**
  * [rsa](./rsa): RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n,
  there exist prime numbers p and q such that `n` = `p` Ã— `q`.
  The problem is to find these two primes, given only `n`
